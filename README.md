# CodeAlpha_Task3 Secure coding Review-Login system
This project demonstrates a secure coding review for a simple login system written in Python using SQLite as the database. It includes both vulnerable and secure versions of the code, identifying key security flaws and how to fix them.
Task Objective

- Audit a Python application for security vulnerabilities
- Identify insecure coding practices 
- Apply secure coding best practices
- Create documentation of findings and solutions
